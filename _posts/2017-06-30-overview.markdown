When running Cytosplore the main window will be mostly empty on startup, as the user interface is completely data-driven.
The main Cytosplore window is separated in three main areas;
* The _Menubar_ on top
* The _Settings Widget_ by default on the left
* The _Main View Area_ by default on the right

When starting a new analysis using the _Analysis_ menu in the _Menubar_ a corresponding settings panel will be added to the _Settings Widget_ and a view widget will be added to the _Main View Area_. When running multiple analyses at the same time the _Settings Widget_ contains a tab for each analysis, while multiple visualization views will be shown at the same time.

Visualization views split into three areas;
* The _Title Bar_ for moving or closing the view
* The _Main Visualization Area_
* The _Visualization Settings Area_

All views in Cytosplore, including the Settings Widget can be _popped out_ in a separate window or closed using the _Title Bar_ of each view.

Views can also simply be repositioned by clicking and dragging the _Title Bar_ of a view and moving the view to the desired position. The blue area shows where the view will be positioned when releasing the mouse button.

Finally, views can be closed or (re-) opened via a right click on the _Menubar_ or any views _Title Bar_. A context menu will open showing all available views, where open views are indicated by a check mark.
